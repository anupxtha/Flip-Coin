# Flip-Coin
Simple Java Programme for prediction of coin flip

A while loop otside initially set to true to play in a loop.
user is asked to choose either head or tail. If user respond is matched with the random number generated by random import module, we can print to user that he/she won the game. 
Now, we will ask user if they wanna play again. If the respond is no, we set play to false and loop ends otherwise the loop continues to repeat until user responds no.
